This script will delete user profiles after a specified number of days and can optionally
save listed account names.

Useful in an enterprise environment where many different logins take place and are not
required to be kept.

The example launchd script runs at each machine boot to launch the script. It could be
modified to run at a timed interval or at each user login via a Login Hook.
